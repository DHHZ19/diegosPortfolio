Using Git is a big part of every developer's workflow whether they use a GUI or the terminal. Wouldn't making things a little faster make it a little more fun?

I present to you `git commit -am` it combines `git add .` and `git commit -m` in one go. That won't solve all your problems though as it won't track new files you have not told Git about. But in many cases, this will help you type a little less. See for me using a GUI has been hit or miss in my current role the main IDE I use is Visual Studio 2022 and I'm working on a large project. Using the GUI for Git causes the whole IDE to freeze up for what feels like a minute. That's why for me using the command line/terminal is much more preferred by me especially when I'm making a lot of commits.

This can can get a bit better though! If you use ZSH there are some predefined git aliases at your disposal. You can shortcut all that typing to simply `gcam "message"` followed by `gp`. For me small things like this can make coding that much more enjoyable, that's why I'm going through the effort of learning VIM motions more deeply.

I hope you found this helpful. I haven't posted in a while so this is me getting back into it.

Happy coding!
